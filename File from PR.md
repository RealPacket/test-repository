# File from PR.

This file was committed via a PR ("Pull Request"), PRs, also known as MRs ("Merge Requests"), are created by making a fork of a repository, commiting some changes, and sending the patch off to a mailing list to get it merged upstream (I'm used to PRs/MRs, and I've never sent a patch ever).
However, we programmers, or developers, think lazy, so we created a solution: "MRs", fork a repository, commit changes, but don't send the patch! Go to wherever the upstream is hosting and submit a pull request using the UI!
Much simpler, right?
